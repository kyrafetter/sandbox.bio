Welcome to the Viral Phylogenetics Tutorial!

Phylogeny the study of how organisms are related to each other through evolution. [Phylogenetic trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) are visual representations of these relationships, helping us understand how different species are connected through evolution.

In this tutorial, we will run multiple sequence alignments on HIV-1 data and generate both, rooted and unrooted, phylogenetic trees using publically available bioinformatics tools.
